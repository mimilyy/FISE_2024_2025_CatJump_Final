This project is part of the Java course in the Second Year of Engineering school. 
Specific objectives have been chosen : 
* Display of Game Over
* A health bar decreases with each collision with an enemy
* The time to escape the level is timed
* A camera offsets the displays to follow the hero in a dungeon larger than one screen.
* Enemies have patterns (patrolling or targeting the hero)
* Stepping on enemies kills them

The goal is to obtain all the coins in the game. 
To use the hero: space for jump and use left and right.
